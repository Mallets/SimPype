Priority
========

The scenario of the simulation is the following:

.. code-block:: none

   |Generator #0| \
                   )-> |Resource #0|
   |Generator #1| /

Where messages generated by ``Generator #0`` have higher priority than messages generated by ``Generator #1``.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/features/priority.py
   :language: python

Where ``p_priority`` model is so implemented:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/model/p_priority.py

``sim.cfg`` stored under the ``log`` folder contains:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/features/log/priority/run01/sim.cfg

``sim.log`` stored under the ``log`` folder contains:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/features/log/priority/run01/sim.log
