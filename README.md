# SimPype #

SimPype is a simulation framework based on Simpy that relies on the concepts of resource and pipe.
SimPype decouples the resource from its queue (pipe) in such a way multiple queueing techniques can be used with the same resource.
SimPype also allows to create both custom resource and pipe models.

SimPype supports Python >= 3.3. Previous versions of pythons are not supported at the moment.
You can install SimPype using pip: 

	$ pip3 install simpype

Documentiation is still work in progress.
